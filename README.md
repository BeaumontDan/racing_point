=================================================

### Description

This is a CSS Style training/learning project, set by [Codecademy][codecademy], untilising CSS Flex-box and Grid.

I chose Racing Point as my 'company', having rebranded the Racing Point formula 1 team during my career as a brand and graphic designer. This project allowed me to expand on this work and develop a landing page untelising those brand assets.

### Codecademy Objective

##### Overview

​This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the Internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.​

###### Project Goals

In this project, you’ll be using flexbox to design and build the layout for a company’s homepage. You can choose to build a new homepage for an existing company or imagine your own dream company!​

##### Setup Instructions
